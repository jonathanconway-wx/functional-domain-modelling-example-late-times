# Functional Domain Modelling - Example: Late Times

This example project is a late times dashboard for truck delivery times.

There are two branches:

- [`before-function-extraction`](https://github.com/jonathanconway-wx/functional-domain-modelling-example-late-times/tree/before-function-extraction) - HTTP handling, domain and presentation logic all mixed up in one Routes component.
- [`after-function-extraction`](https://github.com/jonathanconway-wx/functional-domain-modelling-example-late-times/tree/after-function-extraction) - How these concerns might be extracted to distinct, named and testable functions and types.
